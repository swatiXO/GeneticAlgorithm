# GeneticAlgorithm
Genetic Algorithm to Train a Perceptron (A single neuron model)
# Task
Synthetically create a 2D data set, which is composed of two labeled classes, red and blue, represented
by 0 and 1. Each row of X is one data point, and it is two dimensional, and contains the coordinates of
the data point. Y is the labels of each data point, 0 or 1. This is our training data. We would like to train
the Perceptron with this Data set to learn how to classify these two classes from each other.
Here use a genetic algorithm to train a perceptron. This involves combining principles from genetic
algorithms and neural networks to optimize the weights and biases of the perceptron.
Start by defining the architecture of your perceptron, including the number of inputs, the activation
function, and the structure of the neural network.
Define a chromosome that represents a potential solution. In the context of training a perceptron, the
chromosome could represent the weights and biases of the perceptron.
Generate a population of individuals, each with a set of weights and biases for the perceptron.
Define a fitness function that evaluates how well a set of weights and biases perform on a given task. In
the case of perceptron training, this could be the accuracy or error rate on a training dataset.
Select individuals from the population based on their fitness. Individuals with higher fitness are more
likely to be selected.
Perform crossover (recombination) on pairs of selected individuals to create new individuals. This
involves exchanging genetic information (weights and biases in this case) between the parents.
Introduce random changes (mutations) to the genetic material (weights and biases) to add diversity to
the population.
For each individual in the population, evaluate the fitness using the perceptron with the corresponding
weights and biases. Use a dataset to measure the performance of the perceptron.

Repeat the selection, crossover, and mutation steps for a number of generations. Over time, the
population should evolve to contain individuals with increasingly better sets of weights and biases.
After a certain number of generations, select the individual with the highest fitness as the best solution.
The weights and biases associated with this individual are considered the optimized parameters for the
perceptron.
Update the perceptron with the optimized weights and biases obtained from the genetic algorithm.
